        You wake up at 8:30 am to be at work by 10 am and you are really tired from staying up until 2 am scrolling through Instagram. You were too anxious about the next day where you are going to confront a problem you have at work and watching videos helps
        calm you down. What is the first thing you are going to do when you get up?

        You get ready but it’s taking you longer than normal because your anxiety has caused your limbs to feel like lead and you care but you also don’t care about what you look like and you still need to eat breakfast. You are trying to decide between two outfits
        which one do you choose?

      <div class="optiona">
        <p>
          Jeans and T-shirt

        It is now 9:15 and guess what? You are halfway through putting on your outfit when you change your mind. You switch as quickly as you can into the other option. Your pounding heart is in conflict with your leaded body weight and now you're starting to
        breathe quickly from running around and panicking about leaving on time. You finally make it downstairs with only 5 minutes until you need to leave. You're not hungry for breakfast because your stomach is in anxiety filled knots but you need to
        eat something and don't have time to make breakfast so your only options are a granola and a pack of fruit snacks. Which one do you choose?

        While everything does go smoothly you replay the whole scene in your head and dwell on every word you say wrong for the rest of the day. You end up stuck in your head the whole day and can’t produce one good thought about anything. At the end of the day
        you feel unproductive for not being productive and stupid for overanalyzing when you had no reason too.

          Either of these options are viable for managing anxiety but it is not for everyone. I am no expert on how to deal with mental health and are based on my experience. While this scenerio is made up, the anxiety, physical taxation, and emotional drain are
          all ___.
