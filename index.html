        You wake up at 8:30 am to be at work by 10 am and you are really tired from staying up until 2 am scrolling through Instagram. You were too anxious about the next day where you are going to confront a problem you have at work and watching videos helps
        calm you down. What is the first thing you are going to do when you get up?

        You get ready but it’s taking you longer than normal because your anxiety has caused your limbs to feel like lead and you care but you also don’t care about what you look like and you still need to eat breakfast. You are trying to decide between two outfits
        which one do you choose?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="optiona">
          Jeans and T-shirt

        Sorry you don’t have that option because your rent is due and you need to buy groceries for the week.

        It is now 9:15 and guess what? You are halfway through putting on your outfit when you change your mind. You switch as quickly as you can into the other option. Your pounding heart is in conflict with your leaded body weight and now you're starting to
        breathe quickly from running around and panicking about leaving on time. You finally make it downstairs with only 5 minutes until you need to leave. You're not hungry for breakfast because your stomach is in anxiety filled knots but you need to
        eat something and don't have time to make breakfast so your only options are a granola and a pack of fruit snacks. Which one do you choose?
      </p>

    <div class="optiona">

      <p> You change your mind last minute and decide to grab both because you need the fuel and your indecisiveness is causing you to be late.
          You decide against eating because your stomach has finally settled and you know that food will disrupt that. But, without food you 
          start to feel sluggish and can't think clearly. This affects you until you decide to eat which you won't do until you have 
          this meeting.

      <p>
        You make it to work on time but work instantly piles in front of you and you still have those knots in your stomach. 
        You finally decide to talk to your boss about how your work is impacting your mental health. You get up and head over to their office
        and…
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="optiona">
      <p>
        You talk to your boss about how you are feeling and the meeting goes over smoothly.

    <div class="optionb">
        You back out at the last minute and decide that it will all work out if you just work harder and are productive the whole day.

  <div id="choicefive" class="interactiveSlide">
    <img src="stressed.jpg">
    <div class="mainbox">
      <p>
        While everything does go smoothly you replay the whole scene in your head and dwell on every word you say wrong for the rest of the day. You end up stuck in your head the whole day and can’t produce one good thought about anything. At the end of the day
        you feel unproductive for not being productive and stupid for overanalyzing when you had no reason too.

    <div class="optiona">
        You go home and call someone close to you.

        You pour your thoughts, fears, and worries in a journal until the page(s) are full.

      <div class="mainbox">
        <p>
          You regret not saying anything about what’s going on and lose all the courage you have built up. You are working on your 
          assertiveness and this was the perfect opportunity to practice. But when you didn't speak up for yourself it hurts your 
          confidence in yourself and you're worried you will be walked all over for the rest of your life.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="optiona">
          Decide to seek help from a professional about your situation.

      <div class="optionb">
          Distract yourself by doing something you love for example cooking, reading, exercise, music, going out, etc.

            Either of these options are viable for managing anxiety but it is not for everyone. I am no expert on how to deal with mental health and 
            are based on my experience. While this scenerio is made up, the anxiety, physical taxation, and emotional drain are
            all real things that I felt. It's not easy to put into words what someone with anxiety and indecision goes through but, 
            I hope this narrative engaged you and makes you want to learn more about it.
